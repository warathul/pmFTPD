  pmFTPD 0.5b

  (c) 1999 Philipp Knirsch

pmFTPD is a very simple and small ftp server for UNIX machines. The main
design goal was to keep it as simple as possible with only the basic
functionality and have everything needed in a single application.
The configuration itself is done in one single file with only a couple
of parameters.

The additional feature though that sets it really appart from other open
source ftp servers is the capability to use a SQL database for user verifi-
cation. The functionality has been tested with the MySQL, Oracle 8.05 and
DB2 databases and appropriate modules are included for those databases.

Another feature which only very few servers have is bandwidth limits for
each transfer. This way one can give pretty good estimates on how much data
at max will be transfered over the line for a given number of simultaneous
clients.

For suggestions and/or bug reports just send them to the address given
below, prefered to the email address ;).

Have fun,

Read ya, Phil
