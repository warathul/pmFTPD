2/10/99: Thinking about data structures on how to handle multiple clients.
	 Basic step is to handle all IO with select() call and act upon
         it.
         First idea of database user verification (DUV):

         Parameters in config file with the following entries:

         DatabaseType = <type of the DB: MySQL, Oracle, DB2, Adabas>
         DatabaseHost = <hostname>
         DatabaseName = <name of database>
         DatabaseUser = <name of the user with the appropriate read privs>
         DatabasePass = <password of that user for the DB>
         DatabaseTable = <name of the table which contains usernames/passwords>
         DatabaseUserField = <fieldname of the username in table>
         DatabasePassField = <fieldname of the password in table>

         That should sum it up pretty well.
