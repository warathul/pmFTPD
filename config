# Sample configuration file for the pmFTPD.
#
# Hostname on which the server shall listen. Can be anything as long as there
# is an IP address associated with it. Leave it empty and the server will
# listen on the interface found with gethostname().
#
# Hostname = kleo.eye.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de

#
# Port on which the server will listen. Default is port 21, the standard FTP
# PI port.
#
Port = 4567

# Maximum speed for a single transfer. With this option you can reduce the
# bandwidth being used by a single ftp session to the given maximum. Especially
# in combination with a limited numer of allowed clients at once this can
# help to give a rough estimate of the maximum bandwith used by the whole
# server. Important for people who have to pay per megabyte %^)
#
MaxSpeed = 0

#
# Database specific options
#
# This option lets you select which kind of database you want to use for user
# verification. There are only three possible up to now, but several others
# will be supported soon:
#   Password		Standard good old fashioned password file 
#   Oracle		Oracle 8.0.5 with OCI.
#   DB2			IBM DB2 5.2 with CLI.
#
DatabaseType = Password

#
# Hostname for the database. Unused for now, but needed for later use of Net8
# on Oracle and MySQL.
#
DatabaseHost = db.mydomain.de

#
# Name of the database. Needed only by databases which support multiple
# databases per user. Not needed for Passwd.
#
DatabaseName = test

#
# Username with which the database shall be accessed. Needed only by real
# databases, Password works without it. For all others mandatory.
#
DatabaseUser = test

#
# Password of the database user. I know, it's not nice to have it as plain text
# in here, but i can't see a way around it. Let your DBA set up a user who has
# only extremely limited access to the database (only SELECT on a single users
# table is usually needed).
#
DatabasePass = test

#
# Name of the users table. The minimal assumption here is that you use one
# table to store the usernames and password for the verification. Shouldn't
# be too restrictive :).
#
DatabaseTable = users

#
# Name of the username field. Might be anything you like and use. Should only
# logically comply with your database.
#
DatabaseUField = username

#
# Name of the password field in the users table. Same as above is also valid.
#
DatabasePField = password
